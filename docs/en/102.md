## Who may give evidence of agreement varying terms of document

Persons who are not parties to a document, or their representatives in interest, may give evidence of any facts tending to show a contemporaneous agreement varying the terms of the document.

??? example "Illustration"
    A and B make a contract in writing that B shall sell A certain cotton, to be paid for on delivery. At the same time, they make an oral agreement that three monthsâ€™ credit shall be given to A. This could not be shown as between A and B, but it might be shown by C, if it affected his interests.
