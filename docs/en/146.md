## Leading questions

1. Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to receive, is called a leading question.
2. Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an examination-in-chief, or in a re-examination, except with the permission of the Court.
3. The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved.
4. Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.
