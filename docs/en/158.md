## Impeaching credit of witness

The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls himâ€”
<ol class="outer-list">
    <li> by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit;</li>
    <li> by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;</li>
    <li> by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.</li>
</ol>

??? abstract "Explaination"
    A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may not, upon his examination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be contradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.

??? example "Illustrations"
    1. A sues B for the price of goods sold and delivered to B. C says that he delivered the goods to B. Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, he said that he had not delivered goods to B. The evidence is admissible.
    2. A is accused of the murder of B. C says that B, when dying, declared that A had given B the wound of which he died. Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, C said that B, when dying, did not declare that A had given B the wound of which he died. The evidence is admissible.
