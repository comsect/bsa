## Proof as to verification of digital signature

In order to ascertain whether a digital signature is that of the person by whom it purports to have been affixed, the Court may directâ€”
<ol class="outer-list">
    <li> that person or the Controller or the Certifying Authority to produce the Digital Signature Certificate;</li>
    <li> any other person to apply the public key listed in the Digital Signature Certificate and verify the digital signature purported to have been affixed by that person.</li>
</ol>
